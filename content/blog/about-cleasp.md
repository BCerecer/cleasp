## From an idea to a reality

We've been in the cleaning business for more than 40 years and over this period of time we've noticed that there much that could be improved. Over time, we got the opportunity to create a business that focuses in health rather than clean. This idea comes from our philosophy that just becomes something looks "clean" does not means it really is. This is because there are times when facilities look clean, however, the same rag that was used to clean the bathroom is the rag that is used to clean the kitchen. As you can imagine, this can generate a lot of health problems and ends up spreading around germs. That's why we created a color coded system that strictly gets implemented on all of our services. 

We've all experienced this problem where someone at the office gets sick and then a week later 5 more people get it and it keeps spreading around. Even this problem happened on my previous work, which should have state of the art cleaning facilities. That's why we want to make things differences an create this process which is of great benefit to any business because less germs would mean less sick employees, which produces more efficient work.

There are other situations where the same mop that is used to mop the bathroom is used to mop the office space and then someone drop their phone there and keeps spreading around the germs. All the examples mentioned before are called cross contamination and is one of the ideas that we are looking to implement the most. Later on, we will write more about cross contamination and how to minimize it and even avoid it.
